After you've answered the questions below, check out https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ to learn how to embed images and also format your text to make it more readable.

Tips:
- Note that there is no spell or grammar check on GitHub. I suggest you use another text editor to write your answers, and then paste and adjust markdown in this document.
- If you want to keep a copy of your own work on GitHub, create a repository using your own account and drop your document in that.
